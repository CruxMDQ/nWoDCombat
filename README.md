Ongoing project to create a tool for running New World of Darkness game sessions.

Known issues with existing code:
- Titles in character creation wizard are loaded one step ahead of how they should
- Logic for determining when the personality traits step is complete is wonky
- One of the values in the physical skills allocation step is randomly omitted (point tally in summary step is 6 instead of 7, for example)
- Recycler view in character list fragment is not automatically updating after creating a new character
